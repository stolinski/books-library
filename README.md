This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the `Create React App` guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

To run this project, I use `http-server` to serve the books.json file, and to run the app:

- First, `npm install` or `yarn`.
- Then, `yarn start` or `npm start`.
